    <p style="text-align: center;font-size:40px">From the diagram, we can can clearly see the lack of association between The Rock and other actors in the top 10, with only one reference with Paul Rudd in Wet Hot American Summer. Dwayne Johnson stands alone in this list among the greats like Jackie Chan (who hasn't put out any movies this year, still earned $58 million), Will Smith, and Akshay Kumar. Meanwhile, most of the actors on here can attribute their earnings to the hottest blockbuster ever released (Avengers: Endgame). To top it off, The Rock has earned more this year than any other movie star in this chart ($89.4 million)! He definitely has alot of appeal and needs no other super-successful collaboration to perform better than the rest, another reason why The Rock is unbreakable! </p>

    <center><span style="font-size: 50px">How is The Rock Associated?</span><br></center>
    <center><p style="text-align: center;font-size:40px">Dwayne Johnson has many aliases and is known worldwide by different aspects of his career, but what are his most prominent experiences which define him to many people? Let's investigate this by gathering all the Keywords he is associated with and form a Word Cloud.</p></center>
    <div id='word-cloud'></div>
    <li style="text-align: center;font-size:40px"><u>TV Special</u></li>
    <p style="text-align: center;font-size:40px">As we see, "TV Special" is the most striking Keyword, and this makes sense due to Dwayne's frequent appearences on Late-Night and Award Shows which are known to boost the popularity of its guests. It is possible that Dwayne has garnered so much attention due to his appearences on these programs.</p>
    <li style="text-align: center;font-size:40px"><u>Professional Wrestling</u></li>
    <p style="text-align: center;font-size:40px">They don't call him The Rock for nothing! Professional Wrestling is where he first got his face known to the world and its still common for people to remember him as the WWE/WWF wrestler.</p>
    <li style="text-align: center;font-size:40px"><u>Interview</u></li>
    <p style="text-align: center;font-size:40px">The Rock has always been a funny and relatable character even off the big screen, and his interviews gain so much attention due to the hilarity and honesty. They defintely helped build his image and his social media delivers the same interview-esque vibes he has in professional interviews.</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;font-size:40px">One major thing to notice about this Word Cloud are the prominence of some of the 'odd' associations The Rock has. For instance, there is much emphasis on "African American","Canadian",and "Texan" when we know that Dwayne is a Samoan-American from California. Also notice that even the Keyword "The Rock" is not emphasised as much as his wrestling career, which seems ironic. However, remember that these Keywords only reflects audience trends/misconceptions and shows a broad range of perceived associations about The Rock. Contains weird associations, right?</p>
    <center><img src="/assets/rock_eyebrow_raise_gif.gif" style="height:400px;width:400px"></center>
    <p style="text-align: center;font-size:40px">We've seen how Dwayne Johnson developed his film career, how he fares against today's top paid actors (still number 1!) and how he is percieved by his audience. Overall, the methods of visualizing these factors really did help in figuring out the context of what the data shows. And it shows that The Rock is one of the most successfull actors of our time!</p>
